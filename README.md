## Manuals:
**_FLFM Processing pipline with ExpPSF.pdf_** : <br />description of the experimental PSF processing and 3D reconstruction<br />
<br />
**_Voxel filter.pdf_**: <br />description of voxel-wise filering of reconstructed data <br />
<br />
**_FLFM performance Calculator.pdf_**: <br />description of FLFM performance calculator <br />

## Acknowledgements:
The 3D reconstruction section was adapted from a previous package named **_oLaF - A flexible 3D reconstruction framework for light field microscopy_**
<br /> The adaption is made to improve the implementation of the reconstruction theory as well as to accomodate our preprocessing pipeline and Experimental PSF extraction method.  
 
## Folders:
**_Code_** : <br />Contains all the MATLAB script for processing. The usage is expained in the maunals.<br />
<br />
**_Data_Seisure_**: 
<br />
Contains a subset of the zebrafish brain seisure data. 
The original seisure data was sampled at 30HZ, 451 frames and total 15s. 
The data provided here is downsampled 20 times to reduce the sample data size.
