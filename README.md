# Fourier Light Field Micrscope processing pipeline 
**_This processing pipeline is written for FLFM data processing in the paper:_**
<br />
"A Versatile Light Field Microscopy Platform for Fast Multi-purpose 4D Bio-imaging"<br />

## Manuals:
**_FLFM Processing pipline with ExpPSF.pdf_** : <br />description of the experimental PSF processing and 3D reconstruction<br />
<br />
**_Voxel filter.pdf_**: <br />description of voxel-wise filering of reconstructed data <br />

## Folders:
**_Code_** : <br />Contains all the MATLAB script for processing. The usage is expained in the maunals.<br />
<br />
**_Data_Seisure_**: 
<br />
Contains a subset of the zebrafish brain seisure data. 
The original seisure data was sampled at 30HZ, 451 frames and total 15s. 
The data provided here is downsampled 20 times to reduce the sample data size.
